>A quick tip: Ruin Machines will have increased RES to the first instance of that particular type of elemental damage deal to them, their Physical RES is also very high most of the time.

## Team Comps
<p>
Team Composition that I mainly use in either overworld or Abyss runs.

>Noted that elemental buffers/drivers or DPS can be swapped such as Diluc to Yanfei, Kazuha to Sucrose, Xingqiu to Barbara for a flexible and economical approach to builds. Flexible buffer may include: Diona (C6 EM Buff), Mona, Layla (Shielding), Barbara (Thrilling Tales of Dragon Slayer Buff) etc. <br> Run wild with your imagination!

</p>

### Mono Geo
![Mono Geo](/teams/mono_geo.png "Mono Geo")
<br>
My Trump Card team composition of obliterating everything that is not Geo Aligned. Rotation wise, just pop Gorou's Burst and Itto's Burst in succession after dropping Zhongli's shield and Albedo's flower, energy generation should be able to be covered by Zhongli and Albedo. A truly "Unga-Bunga" play style. Noelle can be swapped for Itto in-place!

### Musou Isshin - Raiden Hypercarry
![Musou Isshin](/teams/raiden_hypercarry.png "Musou Isshin")
<br>
Second Trump Card team composition of annihilating opponents that is not Electro Aligned. Most of the time, Raiden's burst will have 100% uptime due to her immense energy generation, including her teammates. Rotation: Raiden's skill -> Anemo Swirl Shred -> Bennett Burst -> Sara Burst/Skill -> Raiden's Burst, rinse and repeat. Enjoy the beautiful BIG purple number on screen.

### Raiden National
![Raiden National](/teams/raiden_national.png "Raiden National")
<br>
Another variation of the National team to buff our Polearm Archon Xiangling. Here, Raiden's elemental skill is able to buff Xiangling's burst alongside Bennett, with Xingqiu as Hydro driver.
Rotation: Raiden's skill -> Xiangling's skill -> Bennett's Burst -> Xingqiu's Burst/Skill -> Xiangling's Burst -> Raiden's Burst. Noted that Xiangling's burst will snapshot the damage.

### Raiden Taser
![Raiden Taser](/teams/raiden_taser.png "Raiden Taser")
<br>
One word, electro-charged. This team focuses on Xingqiu's rain swords to deal damage in collaboration with Raiden and Anemo Swirls to trigger chained taser. This is where Xingqiu is recommended to use Lion's Roar instead of the usual Sacrificial Sword to maximize the weapon's passive. Rotation wise, use Bennett's burst before Xingqiu and Raiden's Abilities.

### Missile Barrage - Kuki Hyperbloom
![Kuki Hyperbloom](/teams/kuki_hyperbloom.png "Kuki Hyperbloom")
<br>
Single target homing dendro missile. 
Nahida is crucial to the team due to her unique Dendro application, else other Dendro driver can also be used but not that effective. The main purpose is to generate as much dendro seed and then hyperbloom them. Rotation wise, create dendro seed via Xingqiu's Burst and dendro drivers -> hyperbloom them, rinse and repeat. Shinobu can be replaced by Raiden too for maximum hyperbloom intervals.

### Grass Bomb - Thoma Burgeon
![Thoma Burgeon](/teams/thoma_burgeon.png "Thoma Burgeon")
<br>
AoE dendro explosions. Be sure to take a healer or a shield because burgeon will cause team damage! Rotation: create dendro seed via Xingqiu's burst and dendro drivers -> Thoma's Burst + Skill, rinse and repeat. Note that Thoma's Burst pyro driver might be a problem if hes not C6 or have enough energy generation, so Dehya is also a good option. Barbara here can be replaced by another Dendro character if you can survive the bombs.

### Vape Diluc
![Vape Diluc](/teams/vape_diluc.png "Vape Diluc")
<br>
A classic team, with Diluc as DPS and using reverse-vape with the help of Xingqiu using Lion's Roar instead of Sacrificial Sword for maximum damage. Rotation wise: Bennett burst -> Anemo swirl -> Xinqiu Burst + SKill -> Diluc Burst + Skill.

### Melt Diluc
![Melt Diluc](/teams/melt_diluc.png "Melt Diluc")
<br>
Brothers in arm. Almost same twist as Vape Diluc but instead of Xingqiu, Kaeya would be the one applying Cryo on enemy. Same rotation as Vape Diluc but using Zhongli as support instead. Use any other buffer or support in your mind too!

### Star Platinum - Razor Hypercarry
![Razor Hypercarry](/teams/razor_hypercarry.png "Razor Hypercarry")
<br>
A physical DPS team, noted that Razor can be replaced by other physical builds such as Fischl or Zhongli (Cresent Pike) etc. Rotation wise: Razor Skill -> Rosaria Burst/Skill -> Mika Burst/Skill -> Yunjin Burst/Skill -> Razor Burst. If you have Eula, go ahead and run wild, though might need to switch out Yunjin if thats the case.

### Sniper Nahida
![Sniper Nahida](/teams/sniper_nahida.png "Sniper Nahida")
<br>
Sniping 50cal from faraway with this fun and meme build. The sole purpose is to buff Nahida to the extreme and using her Skill (Sniper) to obliterate enemy from afar. Rotation wise: Nahida Burst -> Raiden Skill -> Bennett Burst -> Sara Burst/Skill -> Nahida Skill. Note that Raiden is crucial for triggering the Quicken and subsequent Spread reaction from afar.

### Fridge Hyperbloom
![Fridge Hyperbloom](/teams/fridge_hyperbloom.png "Fridge Hyperbloom")
<br>
The team is called as Fridge because it consist of Dendro as Vegetables, Hydro as Water, Cyro as Ice/Fridge and Electro as Electricity. Either way, this team functions identical to the usual hyperbloom team, but it have the advantage of freezing the enemy. Ideally, a Cyro DPS can replace Layla here.

### Soup Burgeon
![Soup Burgeon](/teams/soup_burgeon.png "Soup Burgeon")
<br>
Another variation of the dendro team comp. The "Soup" Team is called as such because of Dendro as Vegetables, Hydro as Water/Soup, Pyro as Heat and Anemo as Stiring action. Either way, this team functions similiar to the usual burgeon team, but have the advantage of gathering crowds and blowing them up in range of Burgeon reaction.
