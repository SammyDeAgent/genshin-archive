## Team Comps
<p>
Team Composition that I mainly use in either Overworld or Abyss runs.

>Noted that elemental buffers/drivers or DPS can be swapped such as Diluc to Yanfei, Kazuha to Sucrose, Xingqiu to Barbara for a flexible and economical approach to builds. Flexible buffer may include: Diona (C6 EM Buff), Mona, Layla (Shielding), Barbara (Thrilling Tales of Dragon Slayer Buff) etc. <br> Run wild with your imagination!

</p>

### Mono Geo
![Mono Geo](/teams/mono_geo.png "Mono Geo")
<br>
My Trump Card team composition of obliterating everything that is not Geo Aligned. Rotation wise, just pop Gorou's Burst and Itto's Burst in succession after dropping Zhongli's shield and Albedo's flower, energy generation should be able to be covered by Zhongli and Albedo. A truly "Unga-Bunga" play style. Noelle can be swapped for Itto in-place!

### Musou Isshin - Raiden Hypercarry
![Musou Isshin](/teams/raiden_hypercarry.png "Musou Isshin")
<br>
Second Trump Card team composition of annihilating opponents that is not Electro Aligned. Most of the time, Raiden's burst will have 100% uptime due to her immense energy generation, including her teammates. Rotation: Raiden's skill -> Anemo Swirl Shred -> Bennett Burst -> Sara Burst/Skill -> Raiden's Burst, rinse and repeat. Enjoy the beautiful BIG purple number on screen.

### Spring Dragon - Neuvillette Hypercarry
![Spring Dragon](/teams/neuvillette_hypercarry.png "Spring Dragon")
<br>
Another Trump Card team composition of rapid dismantling the opponents that is not Hydro Aligned. Neuvillette is a powerful and versatile DPS where team composition can be varied via Hydro Reactions to maximize his passive talent. In this case however, if without C1, his 3rd passive talent is replaced by Furina as her support capabilities outweights the passive talent. Rotation: Furina's Ousia Skill -> Neuvillete's Burst -> Furina's Burst -> Kazuha's Burst -> Charlotte's Burst -> Neuvillete Charge ATKx2 to Skill to Charge ATK; rinse and repeat. As said, his team is very versatile and you can replace anyone here with other Hydro based elemental reaction triggers.

### Raiden National
![Raiden National](/teams/raiden_national.png "Raiden National")
<br>
Another variation of the National team to buff our Polearm Archon Xiangling. Here, Raiden's elemental skill is able to buff Xiangling's burst alongside Bennett, with Xingqiu as Hydro driver.
Rotation: Raiden's skill -> Xiangling's skill -> Bennett's Burst -> Xingqiu's Burst/Skill -> Xiangling's Burst -> Raiden's Burst. Noted that Xiangling's burst will snapshot the damage.

### Classic National
![Classic National](/teams/classic_national.png "Classic National")
<br>
This is a classic team comp all the way from version 1.0 of the game. Nowadays, Chongyun is seemingly replaced by Anemo supports or other Sub DPS/DPS to boost team damage, either way, this is still a classic premier 4 star team that still hold up to the test of time.
Rotation: Chongyun's skill -> Xiangling's skill -> Bennett's burst -> Xingqiu's Burst/Skill -> Xiangling's Burst -> Chonyun's Burst + Normal ATK. C1 Chongyun here is particular good here to re-trigger Cryo status if paired with C6 Bennett that overrides Pyro infusion.

### Missile Barrage - Kuki Hyperbloom
![Kuki Hyperbloom](/teams/kuki_hyperbloom.png "Kuki Hyperbloom")
<br>
Single target homing dendro missile. 
Nahida is crucial to the team due to her unique Dendro application, else other Dendro driver can also be used but not that effective. The main purpose is to generate as much dendro seed and then hyperbloom them. Rotation wise, create dendro seed via Xingqiu's Burst and dendro drivers -> hyperbloom them, rinse and repeat. Shinobu can be replaced by Raiden too for maximum hyperbloom intervals.

### Grass Bomb - Thoma Burgeon
![Thoma Burgeon](/teams/thoma_burgeon.png "Thoma Burgeon")
<br>
AoE dendro explosions. Be sure to take a healer or a shield because burgeon will cause team damage! Rotation: create dendro seed via Xingqiu's burst and dendro drivers -> Thoma's Burst + Skill, rinse and repeat. Note that Thoma's Burst pyro driver might be a problem if hes not C6 or have enough energy generation, so Dehya is also a good option. Barbara here can be replaced by another Dendro character if you can survive the bombs.

### Dehya Hypercarry
![Dehya Hypercarry](/teams/dehya_hypercarry.png "Dehya Hypercarry")
<br>
With Furina, Dehya offensive capabilities has been increased and seems to be much more consistent, aside from being a DMG mitigation tank. Rotation wise: Furina's Ousia Skill -> Dehya's Skill -> Furina's Burst -> Charlotte's Burst -> Bennett's Burst -> Dehya's Burst + Skill, repeat when Dehya get her burst back. Not great, not terrible, very fun to use for punching enemies to death.

### Burning Crusade
![Burning Crusade](/teams/burning_crusade.png "Burning Crusade")
<br>
This team specializes in dealing continuous Burning DoT. To ensure the character is not constantly being burned from reactions, a shielder is recommended in such comp. Either way, any Dendro character could work here due to Pyro taking alot of elemental gauge on the enemy, just make sure that the Dendro character that trigger the Burning reaction have sufficient EM. Dehya is useful here to mitigate some of the Burning damage and re-enabling Pyro coordinated attacks on enemies to continue the Burning reaction.

### Aggravate Fischl
![Aggravate Fischl](/teams/aggravate_fischl.png "Aggravate Fischl")
<br>
This team mainly focuses on the full potential of Fischl. Using Diona's Constellation 6 that increases EM, Nahida's Burst and also dual Dendro Resonanance, it can bump the aggravate + spread damage to sky high! Just pop all EM increasing buff and apply Dendro Status on the enemies before using either Fischl Skill or Burst; if used correctly, Fischl's Oz will have indefinite uptime by cycling between Skill and Burst. Other EM buffer or Element Support can also be used here. Technically speaking, Keqing can also be used here.

### Vape Diluc
![Vape Diluc](/teams/vape_diluc.png "Vape Diluc")
<br>
A classic team, with Diluc as DPS and using reverse-vape with the help of Xingqiu using Lion's Roar instead of Sacrificial Sword for maximum damage. Rotation wise: Bennett burst -> Anemo swirl -> Xinqiu Burst + SKill -> Diluc Burst + Skill.

### Melt Diluc
![Melt Diluc](/teams/melt_diluc.png "Melt Diluc")
<br>
Brothers in arm. Almost same twist as Vape Diluc but instead of Xingqiu, Kaeya would be the one applying Cryo on enemy. Same rotation as Vape Diluc but using Zhongli as support instead. Use any other buffer or support in your mind too!

### Star Platinum - Razor Hypercarry
![Razor Hypercarry](/teams/razor_hypercarry.png "Razor Hypercarry")
<br>
A physical DPS team, noted that Razor can be replaced by other physical builds such as Fischl or Zhongli (Cresent Pike) etc. Rotation wise: Razor Skill -> Rosaria Burst/Skill -> Mika Burst/Skill -> Yunjin Burst/Skill -> Razor Burst. If you have Eula, go ahead and run wild, though might need to switch out Yunjin if thats the case.

### Freminet Shatter Comp
![Freminet Shatter Comp](/teams/freminet_shatter.png "Freminet Shatter Comp")
<br>
A physical DPS team that focuses on Freminet's shatter DMG bonus. Since Freminet has limited time on his burst duration, he needs to attack very fast to trigger his skill activation and its final Pers (Penguin) DMG. Rotation: Fischl Skill -> Furina Skill/Burst -> Mika Skill/Burst -> Freminet Burst + Pers 4th Skill. That said, Freminet can also go full Cryo route where instead of achieving 4th Pers Skill constantly, he will keep spamming his 1st Pers Skill.

### Raiden Taser
![Raiden Taser](/teams/raiden_taser.png "Raiden Taser")
<br>
One word, electro-charged. This team focuses on Xingqiu's rain swords to deal damage in collaboration with Raiden and Anemo Swirls to trigger chained taser. This is where Xingqiu is recommended to use Lion's Roar instead of the usual Sacrificial Sword to maximize the weapon's passive. Rotation wise, use Bennett's burst before Xingqiu and Raiden's Abilities. You can replace Raiden here with Beidou and go on Full-Counter Mode!

### Sniper Nahida
![Sniper Nahida](/teams/sniper_nahida.png "Sniper Nahida")
<br>
Sniping 50cal from faraway with this fun and meme build. The sole purpose is to buff Nahida to the extreme and using her Skill (Sniper) to obliterate enemy from afar. Rotation wise: Nahida Burst -> Raiden Skill -> Bennett Burst -> Sara Burst/Skill -> Nahida Skill. Note that Raiden is crucial for triggering the Quicken and subsequent Spread reaction from afar.

### Fridge Hyperbloom
![Fridge Hyperbloom](/teams/fridge_hyperbloom.png "Fridge Hyperbloom")
<br>
The team is called as Fridge because it consist of Dendro as Vegetables, Hydro as Water, Cyro as Ice/Fridge and Electro as Electricity. Either way, this team functions identical to the usual hyperbloom team, but it have the advantage of freezing the enemy. Ideally, a Cyro DPS can replace Layla here.

### Soup Burgeon
![Soup Burgeon](/teams/soup_burgeon.png "Soup Burgeon")
<br>
Another variation of the dendro team comp. The "Soup" Team is called as such because of Dendro as Vegetables, Hydro as Water/Soup, Pyro as Heat and Anemo as Stiring action. Either way, this team functions similiar to the usual burgeon team, but have the advantage of gathering crowds and blowing them up in range of Burgeon reaction.
